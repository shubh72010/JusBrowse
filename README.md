# The JusBrowse Project. 

We, have entered to an infinite war... You can't finish off everyone but everyone can finish off you. It's pure nightmare, every API output can pull off the entire mask, the depth the some trackers go in inmesurable, now, you've entered the war, there's no going back... privacy that I am tirelessly trying to protect isn't just a checkbox; it’s a leaking boat. Every time you plug a hole in the Canvas API, the Audio Stack starts leaking. Every time you fix the Audio, the font-rendering engine sells you away.
I might now know why many of devs use basic spoofing instead of going this much depth that I am attempting to go in because you need immense amount of motivation... but for a non profit person like me, it's a difficult for me... BUT I am not a "giving up" type of guy. 

Also, I've looked at this https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs  and honestly,it scares the living hell out of me that how far trackers can go and how less the current browsers protects you.

so yeah, no giving up, motivation high and privacy to max 💪
